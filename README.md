## Description  
Solutions and documentation to tech problems   
## Problem 5: Fermat near-misses  
### Features  
As a user of fermat near-misses(problem5.py), you will be able to:
* Produce near-misses of integer triplets that would satisfy ``a^n + b^n = c^n for some n > 2``.  
### User installation and set up  
* Open terminal  
* Make sure you have python installed, prefferably python3  
* Clone the file and run ``python3 problem5.py -f`` for fermat near misses or ``python3 problem5.py -r`` for the Riemann-Zeta zeroes extension problem.  

## Problem 3: Diction & dictionary scrapping  
### Features  
As a user of diction and dictionary scrapping(problem3.py), you will be able to:
* Download the text on a webpage and output a sorted list of the unique words on the webpage, with counts of the occurrences.  
### User installation and set up  
* Open terminal  
* Make sure you have python installed, prefferably python3  
* Download the file and run ``python3 problem3.py``   

## Problem 4: Markdown engine  
### Features  
As a user of markdown engine(problem4.py), you will be able to:

* Create and activate a virtual encironment `virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 venv && source venv/bin/activate`  
* Install markdown `pip install markdown`  
* Create a file and store the markdown content to be converted. Call the file `markdown.md`
* Download the file in the same location as `markdown.md` and run `python3 problem4.py`  
* The html conversion will be in a new file called `markdown.html`  

## Problem 2: Re-routing/forwarding communication  
## Features  
As a user of re-routing(problem2.py), you will be able to:  
* Forward communication in a manner similar to what ngrok does  
### User installation and set up  
* Open terminal  
* Make sure you have python installed, prefferably python3  
* As a server, run `python3 problem2.py`  
* As a client, uncomment on the client code, comment on the server code and run `python3 problem2.py`   
* Use 2 terminal windows(one server, the other client) at the same time
